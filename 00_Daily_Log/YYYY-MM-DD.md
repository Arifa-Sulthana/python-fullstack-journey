# ✅ Day 1-6 - String Logic + Tuple/Set/Counter Recap

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Tuple vs List
- Set basics (uniqueness, no order)
- Using `collections.Counter` for frequency count
- String reversal and word manipulation
- Real-world logic: building sentence logic with string functions

## ✅ Challenges Solved
- Reverse word order in a sentence
- Reverse only words starting with vowels
- Count unique and most-visited cities
- Daily sales repetition finder with Counter

## 📌 Notes
- Tuples are immutable; lists are mutable.
- Use sets when uniqueness matters.
- Counter is a fast and Pythonic way to count frequencies.
- For string manipulation, always break into list → manipulate → join back.
